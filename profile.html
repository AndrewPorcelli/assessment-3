<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>My main interest is learning. I am fascinated with the aspect of learning new things in the areas I like, such as software development. I started really diving into it around April this year, but I have always been interested in it since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I am very interested in sports. I have played sports my entire life. Currently, the sports I play the most are golf and pickleball. My 2 year old son has been picking up on it super quickly without any help. He started on his own because he would see me swinging my golf clubs inside and he started to do the same on his own volition. My wife has recently started to golf as well. Its a fun family to be part of ⛳️</p>
<p>I have many interests that I could write forever about, but the one I am interested the most in is my wife! She is a super motivator and example to me and she has been there for me through everything!</p>
<br>
<h2 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h2>
<p>I have some career goals that might sound a little odd. My main one is to be able to work for a company that I love. I get excited about the work I am doing and I want to work for a company that is just as excited about it as well. I have aspirations to be a senior developer once I have the skillset and experience. There is a chance I start my own company on the side, down the road. Also, once my career in development starts to come to an end, I would love to teach history or coach football.</p>
